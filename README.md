ðŸ§± WalletConnect - Day 1
This is Day 1 of my journey building progressively complex Web3 projects on GitHub.

ðŸš€ What This Project Does
A minimal Next.js dApp that does:

âœ… Connects MetaMask wallet

âœ… Displays the wallet address

âœ… Shows the current ETH balance

No unnecessary styling or features â€” just raw wallet functionality using Next.js and ethers.js.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Blockchain Library: Ethers.js

Wallet Provider: MetaMask, but works with any such as Brave Wallet and more.
